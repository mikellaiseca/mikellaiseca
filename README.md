### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<h2>:rocket: About me</h2>

Iâ€™m Mikel!

:mortar_board: I am a Full-Stack developer graduated in International Business with previous experience in the logistics and export/import industries, eager to keep learning and improving my coding skills and always looking for new challenges to grow personally and professionally.

:globe_with_meridians: My curiosity and ambition to get out of my confort zone have led me to live abroad in Berlin and SÃ£o Paulo, both to study and to develop my professional career. This experiences helped me to become more autonomous, flexible and used to work in diverse environments. I also learned new languages.

:man_technologist: Over the last few years, I realized how the digital revolution that has already transformed many sectors was reaching my industry and more and more companies, both in the transport of goods and people, are offering their services through web applications. All this aroused my curiosity and made me consider giving a more technological twist to my profile to adapt to the coming changes, so I enrolled in Ironhack web development bootcamp, where I became skilled in JavaScript, NodeJS, ReactJS, Express, MongoDB, CSS and HTML.

The more I discovered about this world during this 9 week intensive experience, the more I felt attracted to it, so I canâ€™t wait to put in practice everything I learned and work alongside other passionate programmers!
